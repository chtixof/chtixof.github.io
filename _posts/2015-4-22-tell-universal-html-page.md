title: Tell, an universal HTML page!
---
I have just been writing "Tell", an HTML page whose content is coded in the URL. So you even do not need a server to have your HTML page :).

Here it is: http://chtixof.github.io/tell/
It relies on:
- [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string) to short-URI-code the content 
- [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) to encode HTML from markdown code
- [goo.gl](http://goo.gl/) to optionaly shorten the URI
